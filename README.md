# Safe Space 
*A carefully designed mobile and tablet-friendly mental-health app. Providing you a space where can track your thoughts and find a supportive community to lean on. Anytime and anywhere.*

## About the App 

Safe Space was initally designed as a journaling app but grew to a larger idea. While you can journal, you can find a community of people that can be your support system as you work through problems or be there to cheer you on when you're having a good day. 

Throughout my mental health journey, I've found that while it's great to speak to a professional, sometimes it helps to speak to someone who is going through something similar. 

Having open and candid conversations about mental health is something i've kept top of mind in all aspects of my life and wanted to showcase it with Safe Space.
